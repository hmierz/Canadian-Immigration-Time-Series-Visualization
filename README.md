# Canadian-Immigration-Time-Series-Visualization
This notebook analyzes immigration data for Canada using pandas and matplotlib. It creates time-series visualizations to explore overall trends and year-to year changes.

## Overview  
This project explores immigration trends to Canada over time using official datasets. The goal is to visualize how the number of immigrants has changed across decades and highlight patterns that may connect with global or regional events.  

## Why This Project Matters  
Immigration is a critical component of Canadaâ€™s economic and cultural development. By visualizing this data, stakeholders such as policymakers, educators, and researchers can quickly identify shifts that align with historical events, economic policies, or international crises. This project also demonstrates data storytelling skills through clear visualizations.  

## Features  
- Time series visualization of Canadian immigration data.  
- Interactive plots highlighting long-term patterns.  
- Clean, well-commented Jupyter Notebook for reproducibility.  

## Technologies  
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## How to Use  
1. Open `canada_time_series.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Run the cells in order.  
3. Adjust filtering options (e.g., country, time span) inside the notebook to customize views.  

## Example Output  
The notebook produces line graphs showing immigration counts over time, with annotations for significant shifts.
